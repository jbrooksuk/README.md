## :wave: Oh, hey!

I'm [James Brooks](https://james.brooks.page), software engineer at [Laravel](https://laravel.com), founder of [Checkmango](https://checkmango.com) and [public speaker](https://eventy.io/speakers/jamesbrooks).

## Now

- Building [Cachet](https://cachethq.io), the open-source status page system. Acquired in 2018, I purchased Cachet back in August 2023. We're now working on [3.x](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet/discussions/4342).
- The [Laravel Artisan Cheatsheet](https://artisan.page). A resource for Laravel developers to learn more about Artisan commands.
- Co-organiser of the [PHP Stoke](https://phpstoke.co.uk) meet-up in Stoke-on-Trent.
- Founder of [Checkmango](https://checkmango.com), a full-stack A/B testing platform. I'm passionate about making the web a better place, and I'm always looking for new ways to do so. If you're interested in learning more about what I'm working on, don't hesitate to reach out!
