## Yo :wave:

Hi there! I'm [James](https://james.brooks.page) and I'm a software developer at [Laravel](https://laravel.com). I build developer services, [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com) and [Envoyer](https://envoyer.io).

I built [Cachet](https://cachethq.io), an open-source status page system. after being acquired in 2018, I bought it back in August 2023. We're now working on [3.x](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet/discussions/4342). 

I now work on the [Laravel Artisan Cheatsheet](https://artisan.page), which is a resource for Laravel developers to learn more about Artisan commands.

I'm also co-organiser of the [PHP Stoke](https://phpstoke.co.uk) meetup in Stoke-on-Trent, along with my friends at [Aware Digital](https://awaredigital.co.uk).

Last but not least, I'm actively developing [Checkmango](https://checkmango.com), a full-stack A/B testing platform. I'm passionate about making the web a better place, and I'm always looking for new ways to do so. If you're interested in learning more about what I'm working on, don't hesitate to reach out!
